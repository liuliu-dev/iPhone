#Imageless iPhone5s

Inspired by TjRus(who implemented iPhone4 in CSS), I tried to draw iPhone 5s in pure CSS, using neither images nor canvas. It's not pixel-accurate, and I'm not satisfied with the settings icon (it would be a great help if you could improve it), but doing such a thing is enjoyable.
