#Imageless iPhone5s

Inspired by TjRus(who implemented iphone4 in css), I tried to draw iPhone 5s in pure css, using neither images nor canvas. It's not pixel accurate, and I'm not satisfied with the settings icon (it would be great help if you can improve it), but it's really fun to do such a thing.
